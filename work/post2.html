                 networks to collect useful data, especially in an organization. Many businesses use

It could include the internal development of customized systems, the creation of database systems, or the acquisition of third party developed software.

            System development methodologies are promoted as a means of improving the management and control of the software development process, structuring and simplifying the process, and standardizing the development process and product by specifying activities to be done and techniques to be used.
            Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types, or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.” Polymorphism is essential to object-oriented programming.
